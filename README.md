# 🚀 Code-Quality-Analysis

> A full-stack, AI-enhanced development environment that offers intelligent, human-style code reviews, file-wise code scoring, and multi-language execution — built by [Shiv Vardhan Singh Sikarwar](https://github.com/Shivvardhan).

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a smart code review IDE designed to deliver:
- ✅ **Human-like feedback** on code quality
- 📊 **Code scores** based on best practices
- 📁 **Multi-file project review**
- ⚙️ **Real-time code execution**

> ⚠️ _Note: Contrary to the project report's mention, this version does **not** use Microsoft CodeReviewer or Google Colab. It uses **Google Gemini API** for all AI-driven feedback._

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Code is written or uploaded into the Monaco Editor.
2. On clicking **Review**, the code is sent to Gemini API via backend.
3. Gemini generates:
   - Review feedback
   - Explanation in human-friendly language
   - Code score (from internal logic)
4. Output is shown per file in the UI.
